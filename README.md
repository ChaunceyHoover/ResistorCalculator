# ResistorCalculator
A simple UI to calculate a resistor's Ohm value, as well as the tolerance range for the resistor.

As of now, it only works with 4 and 5 band resistors. If you have a 6 band resistor, the last band only tells you the temperature range, and if you have a 3 band resistor, I don't ever use them so I didn't implement it, so neither of those will be added in the future. However, it would be pretty easy to add if you _really_ need to add either one.
